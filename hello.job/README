hello.jobs
==========

This sample show a simple Eclipse Job. Eclipse Jobs are executed
in the background and allow to perform batch like processing of data.

The usual way of scheduling Eclipse Jobs for execution is programmatically
by calling one of the Job#schedule methods. This is well suited within
the Eclipse UI were jobs are typically triggered as part of some user action
within the UI. In a typical server environment, it must be possible to start
jobs by operators of a system and/or automated on a regular base.

Cron expressions are very common in specifying when a job should be executed.
Gyrex adds a Quartz based scheduler component on top of the Eclipse Jobs API
as well as the ability to execute jobs on arbitrary worker nodes. This
allows to scale Eclipse Jobs execution across different machines in a
cluster.


Architecture
------------

A OSGI DS component (HelloJobProviderComponent) is used to provide an
OSGi JobProvider service. Gyrex uses job providers as factories for
instantiating jobs on worker nodes.

The HelloJobProviderComponent itself needs an instance of GreetingService
which it passed to the ProcessGreetingJobs.

The ProcessGreetingsJob just calls GreetingService#process which does
some processing on the greeting data.
