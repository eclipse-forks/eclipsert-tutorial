Configuring Eclipse
===================

When developing Eclipse plug-ins an important concept is a
"Target Platform". Simply put, it's like a class path for developing
OSGi bundles using the Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment (PDE).

Target Platforms typically combine bundles and features from multiple
sources. The recommended source "Software Site" is essentially a p2
repository which contains bundles, features and binary artifacts
(eg. launchers).

During this example, we use bundles and plug-ins consumed from
the following update sites.

Equinox:
  http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.8/

Jetty:
  http://download.eclipse.org/jetty/updates/jetty-bundles-8.x/8.1.5.v20120716/

EclipseLink:
  http://download.eclipse.org/rt/eclipselink/updates/2.4.0.v20120608-r11652/

Gyrex:

Orbit:

TIP: Milestone repositories are typically composite repositories which
contain references to other repositories. Accessing a milestones p2
repository might be slow because of the many references to all published
milestones. Instead, access a milestone directly.

TIP: Orbit is a good location to find IP approved 3rd party OSGi bundles.
It does not contain all bundles but a lot suitable for daily development.

TIP: Just append "/repository" to any Orbit build to access its p2 repository.

TIP: Uncheck "Include required software" to be able to install bundles for
all environments. This is necessary when building stacks for multiple
platforms from one single platform. It's also required to install many of
the "Target Component" features available from EclipseRT projects.


Assembling
==========

Target Platforms can be shared between team members (and within any SCM)
by using target definition files. We typically work with two target
definition files. One is called REMOTE. It contains references to all the
remote software sites. A second file, called LOCAL, does not contain
references to remote sites. It resolves all bundles from a location
within the local file system. The target definitions themselves are kept
in an Eclipse project. It can be versioned in any SCM and imported into
Eclipse.

When updating a target definition, the REMOTE target definition is updated
first. Then it is exported to the file system (overriding any previous
content). The new local content is then distributed to team members
(either via SCM or a shared file system). This has the benefit that all
members in the team can usually work off-line. It also guarantees that
all members on the team use the same set of dependencies.
