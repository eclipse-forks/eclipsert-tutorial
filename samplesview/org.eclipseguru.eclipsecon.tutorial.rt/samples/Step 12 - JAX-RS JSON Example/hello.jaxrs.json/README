Hello JAX-RS JSON
=================

This is another example of JAX-RS in OSGi. This time we combine it with
EclipseLink MOXy for generating JSON out of domain objects. The domain
objects can be annotated with plain JAXB annotations to control the
generated output.

In practise, it's also possible to directly annotate your JPA entities
with JAXP annotations and use them as the output of a resource. However,
this only makes sence if the JPA entities make up a good public API.
Remember, the HTTP JSON API is typically a public API and should follow
API evolution guidelines which dicuss things like backwards compatibility.
