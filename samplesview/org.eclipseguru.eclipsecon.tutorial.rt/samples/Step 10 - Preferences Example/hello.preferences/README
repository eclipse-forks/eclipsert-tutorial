Hello Preferences
=================

This is an alternate implementation of the GreetingService. It stores
greetings in ZooKeeper using OSGi/Eclipse preferences. Although in
reality ZooKeeper is not the right place to store a large number of
persistent objects (there are more suitable options), it it's a nice
tool for this demo.

The OSGi/Eclipse preferences API allows to work with different backend
stores. By default, Equinox provides file-based persistence for
preferences which can be stored in the configuration area as well as in
the instance area. Gyrex adds another persistence implementation which
stores preferences in ZooKeeper. This makes those preferences
instantly available to all nodes in the cluster.

The "service.ranking" property of the service component is used to give
this implementation a higher ranking as the default implementation. All
other components depending on a GreetingService will pick the one
with the highest service ranking available.
