Hello JPA
=========

This is an alternate implementation of the GreetingService. It stores
greetings in MongoDB using EclipseLink JPA.

The "service.ranking" property of the service component is used to give
this implementation a higher ranking as the default implementation. All
other components depending on a GreetingService will pick the one
with the highest service ranking available.

In order to have this working, a MongoDB must be setup locally.

The JPA support in OSGi is based on Gemini JPA. In order to activate
it, the Gemini JPA bundle must be started. It does not start automatically.
Additionally, start order is important to simplify the start experience.
Gemini JPA uses byte-code weaving in order to enhance the JPA classes
at runtime. Therefore, the Gemini JPA bundle should be started before
the "hello.jpa" bundle.

Using the OSGi console you can start the bundles manually:

  1. org.eclipse.gemini.jpa
  2. hello.jpa

Until the Gemini JPA bundle is started, the "hello.jpa.component" DS
component will be unsatisfied because it depends on the EntityManagerFactoryBuilder
service provided by Gemini JPA.


Automatic-Start in Gyrex
------------------------

With the help of Gyrex it's possible to avoid the manual start by simply
defining an Eclipse extension for automated start of bundles. Please
have a look at the plugin.xml next to this README to see how its implemented.
