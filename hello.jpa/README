Hello JPA
=========

This is an alternate implementation of the GreetingService. It stores
greetings in MongoDB using EclipseLink JPA.

The "service.ranking" property of the service component is used to give
this implementation a higher ranking as the default implementation. All
other components depending on a GreetingService will pick the one
with the highest service ranking available.

In order to have this working, a MongoDB must be setup locally. Once
the MongoDB is running, you can start the "hello.jpa" bundle using the
OSGi console. It is not started automatically intentionally.
