Hello Feature
=============

The purpose of a feature is to group a set of bundles together. Quite
often the bundle structure is very granular. Although it is a small
unit of deployment, you sometimes like to have a set of bundles delivered
together. That's were features come into play.

Exercise:
---------

* Open feature.xml editor and add all the "hello.*" plug-ins to it
  using the "Plug-ins" tab as well as the "*.jersey" plug-ins

* Export feature to the local disc using the Export Feature wizard
  (File -> Export... -> Plug-in Development -> Deployable Features)
