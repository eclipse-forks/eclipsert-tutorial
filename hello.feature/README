Hello Feature
=============

The purpose of a feature is to group a set of bundles together. Quite
often the bundle structure is very granular. Although it is a small
unit of deployment, you sometimes like to have a set of bundles delivered
together. That's were features come into play.

Exercise:
---------

* Open feature.xml editor and add the following plug-ins to it
  using the "Plug-ins" tab

     hello.*
     javax.ws.rs
     com.sun.jersey
     org.eclipse.gyrex.http.jersey

* Export feature to the local disc using the Export Feature wizard
  (File -> Export... -> Plug-in Development -> Deployable Features)
